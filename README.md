# The Battery Production and Characterization Ontology (BPCO)
The Battery Production and Characterization Ontology (BPCO) was developed in the project DigiBatMat (https://www.materialdigital.de/project/14). It describes production and analysis processes used in battery research. The project was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (FKZ 03XP0367D).
